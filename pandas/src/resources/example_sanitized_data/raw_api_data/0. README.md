This data is reflective of the shape and variety of data we get via APIs

It has been sanitized - we must not commit identifiable data (anywhere in the project)

Many data sets are limited to a few records (e.g., 10), however we can add more as we see different use / edge cases - please add them!

The intention of this data is to:
- Provide an example of what data is available from APIs
- Use in end-to-end integration tests
- Used in unit tests (tests not pulling directly from these files, but we copy/paste sections of the data, or, as unit tests need to handle corner cases, we add those back to these example files)
